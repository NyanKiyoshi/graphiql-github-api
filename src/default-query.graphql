# GitHub's GraphQL API requires authentication thus you need to setup
# a GitHub Token and add it in the headers like so:
# {
#    "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN>"
# }
#
# But replace <TOKEN> with your token (https://github.com/settings/tokens).
#
# Remember: NEVER share the token with anyone, and grant as little permissions
#           as possible.
